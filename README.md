___________________________________________________________________________________

This Client Application is designed to work as a student records system .

This application is a WPF .NET Framework C# application and you need to have 
certain prerequisites in visual studio in order to run it.

You need to have the database designed by me installed in your MySQL Workbench DBMS.
You can find the database in the Backend_Server_Application repository.
